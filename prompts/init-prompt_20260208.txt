I was just in Santa Fe for 2 months then traveled west, through the southwest to the Bay Area, and I've lomg had the idea that each place one visits (place at various scales) has a color palette. Sometimes it's meaningful and intentional, I think, which is the case with Santa Fe, of course, and many places in the southwest that borrow from the color of the earth and sky, the color of the forest, the brilliant sun, and so on. Being a scientist, albeit a social scientist, I'm interested in gathering empirical evidence and use derived palettes in some artworks. And so it's my plan to take photographs of the places that I travel through, and then, in a couple of ways that I've imagined, to extract the palette of the place from the photographs. I can do this by simply looking at the photograph and trying to mimic the color, either digitally or with my watercolors, or eventually with gouache. That's one approach. And the other approach would be algorithmically.

I began with the notebook in this glo project (Geographic Lens on Objects; NB: this may extend to material objects, not only landscapes). You can see in the data/images folder I've copied photos for 10 waypoints on my recent road trip destination into folder (exclude Albania for this phase, which is US road trip only). I experimented with pulling palettes from Santa Fe and Albania some time back. 

Ideally - a long shot I'm sure - I'd like to derive watercolor or guache mixing formulae for a given color. In the meantime, as you'll see in the notebook palette_experiments, I have played with number of colors to identify and something like 'most salient'. 

This was initiated several months ago before Claude Code came available and before Opus 4.6. What I want to do now is set up a workflow using one or more scripts instead of a notebook. Script parameter(s) would allow me to call for a) using a certain set of folders, b) number of colors to extract, c) other parameters, e.g. related to selecting for salience. The parameters will be worked out iteravely as we develop this local workflow.

I'd like your view of the project, generally, things/methods I might be missing, and some next steps to organize things. 

In the case of this road trip, one output I'd like is an image with in effect small multiples going across the 'page' - each segment including patches of colors for the places, east to west. in this case, east to west is [santafe, abiqui, shiprock, tubacity, windowrock, seligman, grandcanyon, redrock, deathvalley, eastbay]. An E-W layout will be so elongated it would be hard to print or view on a screen, so maybe two rows of 5 to start, but ultimately I'll want a generally geographic layout. TBD.

Long story short: it's time to set this glo project up as a sort of toolbox within pycharm I can work with for various thematic sets of images.
